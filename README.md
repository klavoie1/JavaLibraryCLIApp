# Library Management Object-Oriented Practice
Date:_09/10/2025_

## Summary
The goal of this project is to further expand upon my Object-Oriented skills
and practice implementing different ideas to create a fleshed out and comprehensive
CLI application.

## Technologies
This will be a solely Java project. If/when file writing/reading is implemented
then a YAML format will be used. Maven is used to manage the whole project, though currently
there is no implemented dependencies.

## To-Do
Currently, the application uses hard coded Books and Authors. I will be expanding it,
adding the ability to have a text file that can store the data.
